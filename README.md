# TruePass - NFT Marketplace & Blockchain Ticket Validation with INR Payments

A modern NFT marketplace and blockchain-based ticket validation system built with React, TypeScript, and Ethereum smart contracts. Now with Indian Rupee (INR) payment integration!

## Project Overview

TruePass is a decentralized marketplace for buying, selling, and trading NFTs, with an integrated blockchain-based ticket validation system. The platform connects to Ethereum wallets and allows users to interact with smart contracts to manage their digital assets and validate event tickets using Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP).

The platform now features a fully automated INR-native experience that allows users to purchase tickets using Indian Rupee (UPI/Paytm/Credit Card) while still receiving NFT tickets on the blockchain.

## Features

### NFT Marketplace

- Browse and search NFT collections
- Connect to Ethereum wallets
- Buy, sell, and trade NFTs with Indian Rupee (INR) payments
- View transaction history
- User profiles and collections

### Blockchain Ticket Validation

- Generate TOTP-based tickets as NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain
- Validate tickets using time-based one-time passwords
- Offline validation capability
- QR code generation for authenticator apps
- Comprehensive ticket management system

### INR Payment Integration

- Purchase tickets using Indian Rupee (INR)
- Support for UPI, Paytm, and Credit Card payments
- Automatic conversion from INR to ETH behind the scenes
- Gasless minting of NFT tickets after successful payment
- Non-transferable tickets to prevent resale

## Tech Stack

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask or another Ethereum wallet

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TruePass.git
   cd TruePass
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

   ```env
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_storage_bucket
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_firebase_messaging_sender_id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id
   REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_contract_address
   REACT_APP_TRANSAK_API_KEY=your_transak_api_key
   REACT_APP_TRANSAK_ENV=STAGING
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Start the development server
- `npm run build` - Build the app for production
- `npm test` - Run tests
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run lint:fix` - Fix ESLint issues
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run clean` - Remove build artifacts
- `npm run build:prod` - Clean and build for production

### Code Structure

- `/src` - Source code
  - `/assets` - Static assets
  - `/components` - React components
  - `/contracts` - Smart contract ABIs
  - `/hooks` - Custom React hooks
  - `/pages` - Page components
  - `/services` - API and service functions

## Blockchain TOTP Ticket System

### How It Works

#### 1. Ticket Generation

1. Go to the "Blockchain Tickets" page
2. Select the "Generate Tickets" tab
3. Enter ticket details (ID, event name, expiry time)
4. Click "Generate QR Code"
5. Scan the QR code with an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator)
6. Fill in blockchain details (recipient address, seat number, event date)
7. Click "Mint Ticket NFT" to create the ticket on the blockchain

#### 2. Ticket Validation

1. Go to the "Blockchain Tickets" page
2. Select the "Validate Tickets" tab
3. Select a ticket from the dropdown or enter a token ID
4. Ask the ticket holder to open their authenticator app and provide the current code
5. Enter the 6-digit code
6. Click "Validate Code"
7. If the code is valid, you'll see "Valid Ticket! Entry Approved"
8. Optionally, click "Validate on Blockchain" to record the validation on-chain

#### 3. Security Features

- **Time-based Tokens**: Codes change every 30 seconds
- **One-time Use**: Tickets can only be used once
- **Blockchain Verification**: Validation is recorded on the blockchain
- **Expiry Dates**: Tickets can be set to expire after a certain time
- **Offline Validation**: Works without internet connection
- **Non-transferable**: Tickets cannot be resold or transferred
- **Signature Verification**: Secure gasless minting with ECDSA signatures

## INR Payment Flow

### Payment Process

1. **Browse Tickets**: User browses tickets with prices in INR (e.g., â‚¹499)
2. **Connect Wallet**: User connects their Ethereum wallet (one-time step)
3. **Initiate Purchase**: User clicks "Buy Now" button
4. **Payment**: Transak payment popup appears with UPI/Paytm/Credit Card options
5. **Complete Payment**: User completes payment in INR
6. **Conversion**: INR is converted to ETH behind the scenes
7. **Minting**: NFT ticket is automatically minted to the user's wallet
8. **Confirmation**: User receives confirmation with ticket details

This flow provides a seamless experience for Indian users while maintaining the security and validation benefits of blockchain technology.
